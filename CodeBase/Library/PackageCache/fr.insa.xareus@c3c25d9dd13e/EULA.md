#  Annex 1: Description of the Xareus Softwares

**Xareus contains various modules to ease the creation of interactive
applications. The main modules are:**

**Scenario Engine**:

This module, based on the #SEVEN model, can handle and mix different
kinds of graphs (Safe Petri-net, State-machine, decision graph) that can
be extended by on-the-shelf and custom-made elements. The module comes
with a powerful visual editor integrated with Unity3D that can also
display the state of any local or remote scenario in real-time.
Additional functionalities include:

- Save/load of a scenario state

- External sub-scenario (for better reusability)

- Network synchronization of a scenario

- Runtime edition of a scenario

**Relation Engine**:

This module, based on the #FIVE model, provides a standardized way of
describing actions and objects capacities. It also provides a query
engine tailored for complex interactive environments, allowing, for
example, to access the set of objects a user can use to perform an
action while taking into account some constraints. On-the-shelf actions
and object capacities are provided but the developer can add their own.

**Xareus Toolkit:** a set of tools that use the scenario and the
relation engines to provide XR related functionalities, such as smart
highlight of objects (depending on the scenario state, the user
interaction, ...), user interaction management, creation of a scenario
by performing the steps/actions in XR, replay of a scenario by a virtual
agent, hand pose management, ...

**#SEVEN**: a Sensor Effector Based Scenarios Model for Driving
Collaborative Virtual Environments 

#SEVEN is a generic model for representation and a storyline executing
engine in a collaborative virtual environment.

Its architecture enables to take into account discrete or continuous
changes and to trigger them in order to adapt the environment state to
the aims of the storyline.

It allows to describe the actions that users may do, shall do or know
how to do within this context via a dynamic model for role
representation.

**#FIVE**: Framework for Interactive Virtual Environments

#FIVE is a software tools set that enables to ease and factorize the
development of applications for the representation of virtual and
collaborative environments.

#FIVE proposes the following modules:

- Relation module for executing actions by the association of objects
  from the virtual environment

- Interaction module for enabling the user or a virtual agent to act on
  objects from the virtual environment

- Storyline module for guiding or forcing users within their actions, in
  the frame of training for instance

These modules are made to be distributable, in order to enable several
users to act in the same virtual environment.
